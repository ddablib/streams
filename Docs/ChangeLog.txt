Release v3.1 of 08 October 2011
+ Added overloads for 64 bit integer parameters to TStream descendant SetSize and Seek methods.
+ Implemented proper support to IStream implementations for large (64 bit) integer data sizes, seeks and copies.
+ Changed visibility of all IStream implementation methods from protected to public.
+ Implemented work around for error in seeking from end of wrapped TStringStream objects. This is caused by a bug in non-Unicode TStringStream's implementation of Seek.
